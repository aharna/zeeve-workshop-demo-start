# NFT Minting DApp

This is a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) Minting DApp (Decentralized Application) that allows users to create and mint their own unique NFTs on the blockchain. NFTs have gained popularity for their ability to represent ownership and provenance of digital assets.

The DApp provides a user-friendly interface where users can connect their wallets and mint NFTs using predefined or custom metadata. It leverages the power of blockchain technology, ensuring the immutability and traceability of each minted NFT.

Before running the dApp, make sure you have the following:

- A compatible web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, etc.).
- A cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) installed and configured with the desired blockchain network (we will use Polygon mumbai).
