# Setting Up RPC Endpoints in Zeeve

This guide provides instructions on how to set up RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints in Zeeve. RPC endpoints allow you to programmatically interact with your blockchain application deployed on Zeeve. 

## Prerequisites

Before setting up RPC endpoints in Zeeve, ensure that you have the following:

- [ ] Zeeve Account: Sign up for a Zeeve account at [zeeve.io](https://zeeve.io) if you don't have one already.
- [ ] Deployed Blockchain Application: Deploy a blockchain application on Zeeve or have an existing application deployed.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up RPC endpoints in Zeeve:

1. **Login to Zeeve:** Visit the Zeeve website ([zeeve.io](https://zeeve.io)) and log in to your Zeeve account using your credentials.

2. **Select your Application:** From the Zeeve dashboard, select the blockchain application for which you want to set up the RPC endpoints.

3. **Choose plan** Under Buy Services, choose the developer plan to set up RPC endpoint.

4. **Configure RPC Endpoints:** Add "RPC Endpoints" section. Here, you'll find options to configure your RPC endpoints.

5. **Enable RPC Endpoint:** Toggle the switch or checkbox to enable the RPC endpoint for your application. This allows external applications to interact with your blockchain through RPC calls.

6. **Specify RPC URL:** Zeeve provides a default RPC URL for your application. However, you can customize it by specifying your desired URL in the provided field. Make sure to choose a unique and easily identifiable URL.

7. **Choose RPC Protocol:** Zeeve supports various RPC protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket. Select the protocol that best suits your requirements.

8. **Set Access Control:** Determine who can access your RPC endpoint. You can choose to allow all IP addresses or specify a whitelist of IP addresses that are permitted to connect.

9. **Save Changes:** After configuring your RPC endpoints, click the "Save" or "Apply" button to save the changes.

10. **Accessing the RPC Endpoint:** Once the configuration is saved, you can access your RPC endpoint using the specified URL and protocol. Use an RPC client library or tool of your choice to connect to the endpoint and interact with your blockchain application programmatically.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily set up RPC endpoints for your Zeeve blockchain application. This enables programmatically interacting with your application using RPC calls. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the Zeeve documentation or reach out to their support team for guidance. Happy building!
